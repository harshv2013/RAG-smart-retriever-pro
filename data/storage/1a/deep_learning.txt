Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers.

Deep learning models automatically learn feature representations.
Popular architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision, speech recognition, and NLP.
