Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with language models.

The workflow includes:
1. Document ingestion and chunking
2. Embedding generation
3. Vector storage in FAISS or similar databases
4. Retrieval of relevant chunks
5. Answer generation using retrieved context

RAG reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy.
