Advanced Python concepts include decorators, generators, context managers, and metaclasses.

Decorators allow modification of functions without changing their source code.
Generators provide lazy iteration using the yield keyword, making them memory efficient.

Context managers manage resources using the with statement, commonly used for file handling.
Metaclasses control class creation and are used in advanced frameworks.
