Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data.
Instead of being explicitly programmed, models identify patterns and make predictions.

The three main categories of machine learning are:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

Machine learning is widely used in recommendation systems, fraud detection, and image recognition.
