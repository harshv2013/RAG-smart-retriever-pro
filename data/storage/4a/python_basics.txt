Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language designed for simplicity and readability.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
It uses indentation instead of braces to define code blocks, which enforces clean and readable code.

Python is widely used in web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.
