Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models.
Each training example consists of an input and a known output.

Common supervised learning algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
